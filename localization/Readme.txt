Description:

Module for evaluating inline holographic images of arbitrary size.
The interference fringes should be concentric rings and reasonably
seperated from eachother. The average background should be normalized
to 1. Using in inline holographic image, the shape and the location
of the interference fringes can be used to estimate a 3D position of
the scattering particles.
